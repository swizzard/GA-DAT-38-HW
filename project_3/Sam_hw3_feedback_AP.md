Solid job overall, not much to correct, maybe a couple of clarifications:
Q4.6, the interpretation would be more in line with: Students who attended a teir 2 undergraduate school had 0.50 the odds of being admitted to graduate school compared to students who attend a teir 1 undergraduate school.
Q5.3: I'd enhance your observation by adding the following specifics: given the same GPA and GRE scores, students who attended a tier 4 undergraduate school had a 37% probablity of being admitted into grad school, while student who attended a tier 1 school had a 73% likelihood of being admitted into grad school.
