Trying to focus a bit more on your end goal:
Are you hoping to capture the success/failure of a batter against a particular type of pitch, given a set of other external factors? Or, are you hoping to predict one of the three outcomes of a pitch, given those same external factors?
For the first scenario a logistic regression would be a great way to calculate potential success, even assign it a probability rather than having a clear cut success/failure decision. For the second scenario, having a tree based classifier can give you a great ability to capture the many features you've scrapped, just keep an eye out for overfitting. Random Forest will be a good place to start... and you can even try Extremely Randomize Trees (these pick a random split value for each feature, as opposed to RF which uses the most information gained split).
