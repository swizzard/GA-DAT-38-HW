Dynamic topic with a growing body of research. Take a look at the below that shows how machine learning can be applied to generate a model that could lead to better
on-field decisions by predicting a pitcherâ€™s performance in the next inning. Specifically we show how to use regularized linear regression to learn 
pitcher-specific predictive models that can be used to estimate whether a starting pitcher will surrender a run if allowed to start the next inning.
