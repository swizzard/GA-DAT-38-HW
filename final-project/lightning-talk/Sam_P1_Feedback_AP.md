One of the most helpful things about sports related predictive models is feature engineering. In addition to the pitch type and pitch speed... can you factor in player fatigue some how? Perhaps the pitch count, inning number, length the game has been played up to that pitch? I would imagine the effectiveness and delivery of a particular off-speed pitch would decline with fatigue. 
Seems like batting average will be a good measure of success/failure, and a linear regression will be a great way to go in terms of modeling. The more features you can cram into the model, then use regularization to weed out the unhelpful ones seems like it would be a great apprach.
